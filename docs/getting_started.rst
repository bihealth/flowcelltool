This section gives an overview of how the application works.
Flowcelltool allows you to manage flow cells on libraries with a graphical and then create sample sheets for the Illumina demultiplexing software.
To facilitate this, you will need to register your sequencing devices (for configuring dual indexing workflow used) and the adapter barcode sequence used.

The overall workflow after the initial installation is:

1. `Create or import adapter barcode libraries <import_barcodes>`_
2. `Register your sequencers <create_sequencers>`_
3. `Manage the users in the datbase <manage_user>`_

Once this is complete, you can start

- `Adding your flow cells <add_flowcells>`_.
