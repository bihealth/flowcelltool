Import Barcodes
===============

.. warning::

   This is provisional information and needs some work.

By default, the database of the web application is completely empty.
The first thing to add is a few barcodes.

- Download barcodes from [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/bihealth/flowcelltool/wiki)
  - Create JSON files by copy-and-paste the "cat ... EOF" text

- Click "Barcodes" icon at the top
- Click "Import"
    - Use the form to import the JSON adapter files

When, you are done, follow the "Create Sequencers" guide.
