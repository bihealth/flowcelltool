.. warning::

   This is provisional information and needs some work.

You need to preregister all sequencers for which you want to perform demultiplexing.
This is primarily used for the secondary barcode indexing workflow.

- Click on "Sequencers" at the top
- Add your sequencers.

Then, go ahead and register some flow cells.
